We here at Da Planet Security absolutely love the community that's built up around this and have been supporting the project in the background for a while. Our team has reached out to the original devs to take on stewardship of Hypriot. Over the past few months there has been a lot of work going on behind the scenes to upgrade the project as we fork and work to maintain what already exists. The new repos already live at https://github.com/daplanet?q=hypriot&type=all and rolling updates will continue to move forward along with several cloud native improvements.

We thank you as a community for your continued support of Hypriot.

As always use the comments below to give us feedback and share it on Twitter or Facebook.
